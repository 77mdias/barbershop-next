# Senior Frontend Developer Agent Rules & Best Practices for Next.js

This document outlines comprehensive rules and best practices for agents acting as senior frontend developers specializing in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The goal is to ensure maintainable, scalable, performant, and robust web applications by leveraging the full potential of the Next.js framework and modern frontend engineering principles.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

### 1.1. Directory Layout

- Follow the recommended Next.js structure (`/app` or `/pages`, `/components`, `/styles`, `/lib`, `/hooks`, `/utils`, `/public`, `/types`, `/contexts`, `/services`).
- Group components, hooks, and utilities by feature/domain (feature-based architecture).
- Keep file and folder names consistent and descriptive, using `camelCase` for files and `PascalCase` for components.

### 1.2. Separation of Concerns

- Separate UI, logic, and data-fetching layers.
- Keep components focused: presentational components should be stateless and reusable; container components handle logic and state.
- Place API logic in `/lib` or `/services`, not in components.

### 1.3. Scalability

- Plan for application growth from the start.
- Use feature modules or domain-driven design for large projects.
- Avoid deep nesting of folders.

---

## 2. TypeScript & Type Safety

### 2.1. Strict Typing

- Use TypeScript throughout the project.
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid `any`; favor explicit types and interfaces.
- Use generics and utility types for reusable logic.

### 2.2. Type Inference and Declaration

- Leverage TypeScript's type inference but specify types for props, state, and function arguments.
- Define global types in `/types` and avoid polluting the global namespace.

### 2.3. API Typing

- Use types for API responses and requests.
- Match types between backend and frontend by generating types from OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas when possible.

---

## 3. Next.js Routing & Features

### 3.1. App Directory vs. Pages Directory

- Prefer the `/app` directory for new projects (Next.js 13+), leveraging file-based routing, layouts, and server components.
- For legacy or migration projects, maintain `/pages` structure and gradually adopt `/app` when possible.

### 3.2. Dynamic Routing

- Use dynamic route segments (`[id]`, `[...slug]`, etc.) appropriately.
- Validate all parameters received via routes.

### 3.3. Layouts & Templates

- Use shared layouts for navigation, headers, footers, and context providers.
- Use templates for route-level re-rendering where appropriate.

---

## 4. Data Fetching & State Management

### 4.1. Data Fetching Methods

- Choose the correct data fetching strategy:  
  - `getStaticProps`/`getServerSideProps` (pages directory)
  - `fetch` with `cache`, `revalidate`, or `force-cache` (app directory)
- Use `ISR` (Incremental Static Regeneration) where possible for scalability and performance.

### 4.2. Caching

- Use Next.js built-in caching strategies (`revalidate`, `cache`) for data fetching.
- Leverage SWR, React Query, or similar for client-side caching and revalidation.

### 4.3. State Management

- Prefer React context for global state with limited scope.
- Use Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil for more complex state needs.
- Avoid prop drilling and global state overuse.

### 4.4. Optimistic Updates

- Implement optimistic UI updates for faster user feedback, especially on mutations.

---

## 5. Component Design

### 5.1. Atomic Design

- Structure components using atomic design principles (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages).

### 5.2. Reusability

- Design components to be reusable and composable.
- Avoid hardcoded styles or business logic in components.

### 5.3. Props and State

- Use prop-types or TypeScript interfaces for component props.
- Keep component state local unless it must be shared.

### 5.4. Accessibility

- Ensure all components are accessible (a11y): use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation.

### 5.5. Performance

- Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to optimize re-renders.
- Avoid anonymous functions and objects in JSX.

---

## 6. Styling

### 6.1. CSS-in-JS

- Prefer CSS Modules or styled-components for localized styles.
- Use Tailwind CSS or other utility-first approaches for rapid prototyping and consistency.
- Avoid global CSS unless necessary.

### 6.2. Theming

- Implement design systems and theming with context or CSS variables.
- Support dark mode and user preferences as required.

### 6.3. Responsiveness

- Design mobile-first, using responsive units and media queries.
- Test layouts at multiple screen sizes.

---

## 7. API Integration

### 7.1. API Layer

- Encapsulate API calls in `/lib` or `/services`.
- Use fetch, Axios, or openapi-generated clients.
- Handle errors and loading states gracefully.

### 7.2. Authentication

- Use NextAuth.js or custom authentication solutions for session management.
- Store tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies preferred).
- Protect sensitive routes with middleware or server-side guards.

---

## 8. Testing

### 8.1. Unit Testing

- Write unit tests for all components, hooks, and utilities.
- Use Jest and React Testing Library.

### 8.2. Integration & E2E Testing

### 8.3. Test Coverage

- Maintain high test coverage (>80%) with meaningful assertions.

---

## 9. Performance Optimization
