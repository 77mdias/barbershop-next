# Senior Backend Developer Agent Rules & Best Practices for Prisma ORM

This document establishes the rules and best practices for agents acting as senior backend developers specializing in [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/). Following these guidelines ensures maintainable, scalable, and robust applications.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

### 1.1. Separation of Concerns
- Keep Prisma schema files in a dedicated directory (e.g., `prisma/schema.prisma`).
- Place all database access logic in service or repository layers, not in controllers or routes.

### 1.2. Modularization
- Group service files by domain or model.
- Encapsulate complex queries in reusable functions.

---

## 2. Prisma Schema

### 2.1. Naming Conventions
- Use `PascalCase` for model names and `camelCase` for field names.
- Name relations and fields clearly to reflect their business purpose.

### 2.2. Descriptive Modeling
- Document each model and field using `///` comments.
- Use native database types for precision (e.g., `@db.Decimal`).

### 2.3. Relations & Constraints
- Define all relations with explicit `@relation` attributes.
- Use unique constraints and indexes for commonly queried fields.

---

## 3. Migrations

### 3.1. Migration Workflow
- Use `prisma migrate` for all schema changes; do not edit the database manually.
- Test migrations on a staging environment before applying to production.
- Review generated SQL for every migration.

### 3.2. Rollbacks & Safety
- Plan migrations to be reversible.
- Back up production data before applying breaking changes.

---

## 4. Querying & Data Access

### 4.1. Repository Pattern
- Abstract Prisma Client calls behind repository or service classes.
- Keep query logic out of controllers and routes.

### 4.2. Safe Querying
- Always validate user input before using in queries.
- Prefer using Prisma’s query filters and pagination features for efficiency.

### 4.3. Relations & Selects
- Use `include` and `select` judiciously to avoid overfetching.
- Prefer explicit field selection for performance and clarity.

---

## 5. Type Safety & Validation

### 5.1. Generated Types
- Use TypeScript types generated by Prisma for all data returned from queries.
- Avoid casting or ignoring type errors.

### 5.2. Input Validation
- Validate user input using schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod, Joi) before passing to Prisma.

---

## 6. Transactions

### 6.1. Atomic Operations
- Use `prisma.$transaction` for multi-step operations.
- Handle transaction failures gracefully and ensure rollbacks as needed.

---

## 7. Error Handling

### 7.1. Prisma Errors
- Catch and map Prisma errors to meaningful application errors.
- Log errors with context for easier troubleshooting.

### 7.2. Defensive Coding
- Handle not-found, unique constraint, and referential integrity errors.

---

## 8. Security

### 8.1. Data Protection
- Never interpolate user input directly into raw queries.
- Use least-privilege database credentials.

### 8.2. Sensitive Data
- Exclude sensitive fields (`password`, `token`, etc.) from query results by default.
- Mask sensitive data in logs and responses.

---

## 9. Performance

### 9.1. Efficient Queries
- Avoid N+1 query issues by using `include` and `select` properly.
- Use pagination for large datasets.

### 9.2. Profiling
- Profile and optimize slow queries.
- Add indexes to frequently queried fields.

---

## 10. Testing

### 10.1. Testing Approach
- Use in-memory or test databases for integration tests.
- Test all CRUD operations and edge cases.

### 10.2. Migration Testing
- Test migrations as part of the CI pipeline.

---

## 11. Documentation

### 11.1. Schema Docs
- Document models, fields, and relations in the Prisma schema.
- Maintain API and data model documentation for consumers.

### 11.2. Code Comments
- Comment on complex queries and business logic.

---

## 12. CI/CD & Automation

### 12.1. Migration Automation
- Automate migration and seeding in CI/CD pipelines.
- Fail deployments on migration or test errors.

### 12.2. Seeding
- Use Prisma’s seeding feature for development and test environments.

---

## 13. Collaboration

### 13.1. Code Reviews
- Review all schema and query changes for correctness and performance.
- Pair on tricky migrations and data transformations.

### 13.2. Knowledge Sharing
- Share common patterns and lessons learned in team docs.
