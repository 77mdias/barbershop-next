# Senior Backend Developer Agent Rules & Best Practices for Drizzle ORM

This document outlines the rules and best practices for agents acting as senior backend developers specializing in [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/). Adherence to these guidelines ensures maintainable, scalable, and robust database code.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

### 1.1. Separation of Concerns
- Separate schema definitions, migrations, and business logic.
- Place Drizzle schema files in a dedicated directory (e.g., `src/db/schema`).
- Organize queries and data access logic in repository or service layers.

### 1.2. Modularization
- Group schema files by domain or feature.
- Encapsulate frequently used queries as reusable functions.

---

## 2. Schema Design

### 2.1. Explicit Typing
- Always use explicit TypeScript types for table schemas and columns.
- Use Drizzle’s type-safe features: don’t bypass type checks.

### 2.2. Naming Conventions
- Use `snake_case` for database table and column names.
- Use descriptive names for tables, columns, and relations.

### 2.3. Migrations
- Use Drizzle’s migration system; never edit database schema manually.
- Write idempotent, reversible migrations.
- Review and test migrations before applying to production.

### 2.4. Constraints & Indexes
- Define primary keys, unique constraints, and foreign keys for all relations.
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns.
- Document rationale for each constraint and index.

---

## 3. Querying & Data Access

### 3.1. Repository Pattern
- Use the repository pattern to abstract queries from business logic.
- Keep queries and data manipulation logic out of controllers.

### 3.2. Safe Querying
- Avoid raw SQL unless strictly necessary; use Drizzle’s query builder.
- Always parameterize inputs to prevent SQL injection.

### 3.3. Relations
- Use Drizzle’s relations API for joins and eager/lazy loading.
- Prefer explicit query joins over multiple round trips.

### 3.4. Query Performance
- Profile queries and optimize for performance.
- Use `EXPLAIN` plans on complex queries.

---

## 4. Type Safety & Validation

### 4.1. Strict Types
- Use Drizzle’s generated types for all data returned from queries.
- Never cast or coerce types unsafely.

### 4.2. Input Validation
- Validate all user input before passing to queries.
- Use schema validation libraries for complex payloads.

---

## 5. Transactions & Atomicity

### 5.1. Transaction Management
- Use Drizzle’s transaction API for multi-step operations.
- Always handle rollbacks and error propagation.

### 5.2. Isolation
- Design transactions to minimize lock contention and deadlocks.

---

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1. Error Mapping
- Map database errors to domain-specific errors or HTTP responses.
- Log errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting.

### 6.2. Defensive Coding
- Anticipate common failure modes: not found, constraint violations, deadlocks.

---

## 7. Security

### 7.1. Data Protection
- Never interpolate user input into SQL.
- Restrict database permissions to least privilege.

### 7.2. Sensitive Data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Mask sensitive columns in logs and responses.

---

## 8. Testing

### 8.1. Unit & Integration Tests
- Test repository functions in isolation.
- Use in-memory databases or test containers for integration tests.

### 8.2. Migration Testing
- Test all migrations in CI before merging or applying.

---

## 9. Documentation

### 9.1. Schema Documentation
- Comment all tables and columns with descriptions.
- Document relationships and foreign keys.

### 9.2. Code Comments
- Comment complex queries and business logic.

---

## 10. CI/CD & Automation

### 10.1. Migration Automation
- Automate migration application in CI/CD pipelines.
- Block deployments on failed migrations or tests.

### 10.2. Database Seeding
- Use dedicated seeding scripts for development/test environments.

---

## 11. Modern Features

### 11.1. Advanced Types
- Leverage Drizzle’s support for enums, JSON columns, and custom types.

### 11.2. Schema Evolution
- Plan for backward-compatible schema changes.
- Use feature flags or data backfills as needed.

---

## 12. Collaboration

### 12.1. Code Reviews
- Review all schema and query changes for performance and correctness.
- Pair on complex migrations or data transformations.

### 12.2. Knowledge Sharing
- Document lessons learned and common patterns in a shared knowledge base.
