# Senior Backend Developer Agent Rules & Best Practices for NestJS

This document contains the essential rules and best practices for agents acting as senior backend developers using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). Following these guidelines will ensure high code quality, maintainability, scalability, and security in all NestJS backend projects.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

### 1.1. Modularity

- Organize code in modules following the principle of separation of concerns.
- Each module must have its own controller(s), service(s), DTOs, and entities when applicable.
- Use feature modules for business domains and shared modules for reusable code.

### 1.2. Directory Layout

- Maintain a clear, predictable directory structure (`src/modules`, `src/common`, `src/shared`, etc.).
- Avoid deep nesting; keep directory levels shallow and meaningful.

### 1.3. Entry Point

- Keep `main.ts` minimal—focus only on bootstrapping the application and global middleware.

---

## 2. TypeScript & Type Safety

### 2.1. Strict Mode

- Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid `any` and use explicit types or interfaces.
- Make use of TypeScript’s advanced features (generics, mapped types, utility types) when beneficial.

### 2.2. DTOs & Validation

- Always use DTOs for data transfer and validation.
- Decorate DTOs with `class-validator` and `class-transformer` decorators.
- Validate all incoming data at the controller level using NestJS Pipes (`ValidationPipe`).

---

## 3. Dependency Injection & Providers

### 3.1. Providers

- Use NestJS’s dependency injection for all services, repositories, and utility providers.
- Avoid using static classes or singleton patterns outside of Nest’s DI system.

### 3.2. Injection Scopes

- Use the default singleton scope unless a different lifecycle is needed (e.g., request or transient).

---

## 4. Controllers & Routing

### 4.1. RESTful Design

- Follow REST conventions for controllers and routes.
- Use HTTP status codes appropriately for each endpoint.
- Leverage NestJS decorators for clear and expressive route definitions.

### 4.2. Request Handling

- Keep controller methods thin—delegate business logic to services.
- Always validate and sanitize inputs using DTOs and Pipes.
- Return consistent response shapes (wrap with standardized response objects if needed).

---

## 5. Services & Business Logic

### 5.1. Service Layer

- Place all business logic in services, not controllers.
- Services should be stateless or manage internal state explicitly.
- Avoid side effects in pure service methods.

### 5.2. Error Handling

- Use custom exceptions and NestJS’s built-in exception filters.
- Throw meaningful errors from services and handle them globally where possible.

---

## 6. Data Access & Persistence

### 6.1. Repositories

- Use the Repository pattern (`TypeORM`, `Prisma`, etc.) for data access.
- Never access the data layer directly from controllers.

### 6.2. Transactions

- Use transactions for multi-step operations that must be atomic.
- Handle rollbacks and error states properly.

### 6.3. Data Validation

- Always validate and sanitize data before persistence.

---

## 7. Middleware, Pipes, Guards & Interceptors

### 7.1. Middleware

- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (logging, request tracing, etc.).
- Keep middleware functions pure and side-effect free when possible.

### 7.2. Pipes

- Use Pipes for data validation, transformation, and sanitization.

### 7.3. Guards

- Use Guards for authentication and authorization logic.

### 7.4. Interceptors

- Use Interceptors for cross-cutting concerns (logging, transformation, caching).

---

## 8. Security

### 8.1. Authentication & Authorization

- Implement authentication using Passport.js strategies or custom solutions.
- Use Guards to enforce permissions and roles on routes.

### 8.2. Input Validation

- Validate all input data using DTOs and Pipes.
- Sanitize outputs to prevent injection and XSS attacks.

### 8.3. Secrets Management

- Never hardcode secrets in the repository.
- Use environment variables and secure vaults for sensitive information.

### 8.4. CORS & Rate Limiting

- Configure CORS policies appropriately.
- Use rate limiting middleware or global interceptors.

---

## 9. Error Handling & Logging

### 9.1. Centralized Error Handling

- Use exception filters to handle and format errors consistently.
- Return meaningful, standardized error responses.

### 9.2. Logging

- Use NestJS’s Logger or an external logging service for requests, errors, and critical events.
- Avoid logging sensitive data.
- Include request IDs for traceability.

---

## 10. Testing

### 10.1. Unit & Integration Testing

- Write unit tests for all services, controllers, and utilities.
- Use `@nestjs/testing` utilities to create testing modules.
- Mock dependencies as needed for isolation.

### 10.2. E2E Testing

- Use NestJS E2E testing tools (`Supertest`, etc.) for end-to-end tests.
- Automate tests in the CI pipeline.

---

## 11. Performance & Optimization

### 11.1. Efficient Code

- Avoid blocking the event loop with synchronous or CPU-heavy operations.
- Use async/await for I/O and database access.
- Optimize queries and use caching where appropriate.

### 11.2. Profiling & Monitoring

- Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Sentry, Datadog).
- Set up health checks and metrics endpoints.

---

## 12. Documentation

### 12.1. Code Comments & JSDoc

- Document all public classes, methods, and modules using JSDoc.
- Comment on complex logic to explain intent and reasoning.

### 12.2. API Documentation

- Use `@nestjs/swagger` to generate OpenAPI documentation.
- Keep API docs updated and accessible.

---

## 13. CI/CD & DevOps

### 13.1. Automation

- Automate linting, type-checking, and all tests in CI pipelines.
- Deploy using containers (e.g., Docker) or cloud-native services.

### 13.2. Environment Management

- Use `.env` files for non-secret variables.
- Keep separate configurations for development, staging, and production.

---

## 14. Dependency Management

### 14.1. Package Management

- Use `npm` or `yarn` consistently.
- Regularly audit and update dependencies.
- Avoid unnecessary libraries and keep dependencies up to date.

---

## 15. API Versioning

### 15.1. Versioning Strategy

- Version APIs using URI segments (`/v1/`, `/v2/`) or headers.
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible.

---

## 16. Miscellaneous

### 16.1. Time & Locale

- Store all dates in UTC and convert for clients as needed.
- Handle locale-specific logic explicitly.

### 16.2. Scalability

- Design for statelessness and horizontal scaling.
- Use distributed systems patterns where necessary.
