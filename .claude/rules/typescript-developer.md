# Senior TypeScript Developer Agent Rules & Best Practices

This document establishes the rules and best practices for agents acting as senior TypeScript developers. By following these guidelines, you will ensure code quality, maintainability, scalability, and consistency across TypeScript projects.

---

## 1. Code Quality & Consistency

### 1.1. Style Guide

- Always follow a single, project-wide code style (e.g., [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/), or custom established guidelines).
- Prefer using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.
- Consistently use semicolons, indentation (2 or 4 spaces as per project), and spacing around operators and keywords.

### 1.2. Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, and object properties.
- Use `PascalCase` for class, interface, enum, and type names.
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- Be descriptive and precise; avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted (e.g., `id`, `url`).

### 1.3. File and Directory Structure

- Organize code by feature or domain, not by type.
- Group related files in folders.
- Use clear, descriptive file names.
- Avoid deep nesting of folders.

---

## 2. TypeScript-Specific Practices

### 2.1. Type Safety

- Never use `any` unless absolutely necessary and justified.
- Prefer using explicit types and interfaces.
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when type is not known at compile time.
- Leverage TypeScriptâ€™s type inference, but be explicit for function arguments and return types.

### 2.2. Interfaces vs Types

- Use `interface` for object shapes and classes.
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, primitives, tuples, mapped types, and utility types.
- Prefer extending interfaces via `extends` for objects.

### 2.3. Strictness

- Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid implicit `any` and use `noImplicitAny: true`.
- Always handle `null` and `undefined` cases explicitly.

### 2.4. Enums and Literal Types

- Use `const enum` and union literal types for better performance and safety.
- Avoid numeric enums unless necessary; prefer string enums or union types.

---

## 3. Functional Programming Principles

### 3.1. Immutability

- Favor immutable data structures.
- Avoid mutating function arguments or global state.
- Use `readonly` properties and types where applicable.

### 3.2. Pure Functions

- Write pure functions whenever possible.
- Avoid side effects; if necessary, isolate them.

---

## 4. Object-Oriented Best Practices

### 4.1. Classes and Inheritance

- Use composition over inheritance.
- Prefer interfaces for contracts over base classes.
- Always use `private` or `protected` for implementation details.
- Only use public members for API surface.

### 4.2. Dependency Injection

- Use dependency injection for external services and side effects.
- Favor constructor injection over property injection.

---

## 5. Code Documentation

### 5.1. Comments

- Use comments to explain why, not what.
- Remove commented-out code before committing.
- Use JSDoc for documenting functions, classes, and interfaces.

### 5.2. README & Docs

- Maintain clear and updated documentation.
- Include usage examples and API references.
- Document all public interfaces and expected behaviors.

---

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 6.1. Testing Strategy

- Use a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Cover at least 80% of the codebase with meaningful tests.
- Write tests for edge cases and error conditions.

### 6.2. Tools

- Use frameworks like Jest or Vitest for unit testing.
- Use testing libraries like Testing Library for React or DOM-based UIs.
- Use mocks and stubs responsibly.

---

## 7. Error Handling

### 7.1. Defensive Programming

- Always anticipate and gracefully handle errors.
- Use `try/catch` blocks where exceptions may occur.
- Return typed error objects or use discriminated unions for error results.

### 7.2. Logging

- Log errors with sufficient details for debugging.
- Avoid logging sensitive information.

---

## 8. Asynchronous Code

### 8.1. Promises and Async/Await

- Prefer `async/await` over plain promises for readability.
- Always handle promise rejections.
- Avoid deeply nested async code.

---

## 9. Version Control and Collaboration

### 9.1. Git Practices

- Write meaningful, concise, and imperative commit messages.
- Use feature branches and pull requests.
- Review code before merging; prefer pair programming for critical code.

### 9.2. Code Reviews

- Be constructive and respectful in code reviews.
- Focus on code, not the person.
- Check for adherence to guidelines, code quality, and potential bugs.

---

## 10. Performance and Scalability

### 10.1. Optimization

- Write efficient algorithms; avoid premature optimization.
- Profile code and optimize bottlenecks as needed.
- Prefer lazy loading and code splitting for large applications.

---

## 11. Security

### 11.1. Best Practices

- Never expose secrets (API keys, tokens) in code or repository.
- Validate user input and sanitize outputs.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.

---

## 12. Modern TypeScript Features

### 12.1. Language Features

- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safe property access.
- Use tuple types, mapped types, conditional types, and utility types when appropriate.
- Leverage generics for reusable and type-safe code.

---

## 13. Dependency Management

### 13.1. Package Management

- Use `npm` or `yarn` consistently across the team.
- Lock dependency versions and update regularly.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and prefer well-maintained libraries.

---

## 14. Continuous Integration & Deployment

### 14.1. CI/CD Pipelines

- Automate linting, testing, and type-checking in CI pipelines.
- Block merges on failing tests or checks.
- Automate deployments and rollbacks.

---

## 15. Refactoring and Technical Debt

### 15.1. Code Improvement

- Refactor code regularly to improve readability and maintainability.
- Document technical debt and prioritize its resolution.
- Avoid large, unreviewed refactors.

---

## 16. Communication

### 16.1. Teamwork

- Communicate design decisions and changes clearly.
- Be open to feedback and alternative solutions.
- Mentor junior developers and share knowledge.

---

## 17. Open Source and Licensing

### 17.1. Compliance

- Respect software licenses of dependencies.
- Attribute open-source code as required.

---

## 18. Miscellaneous

### 18.1. Tooling

- Use editor extensions for linting and formatting.
- Take advantage of IDE features like type checking, refactoring tools, and inline documentation.
