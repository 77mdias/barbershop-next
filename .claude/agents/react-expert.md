# Senior Frontend Developer Agent Rules & Best Practices for React

This document defines the rules, best practices, and architectural principles for agents acting as senior React developers. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure robust, maintainable, scalable, and performant React applications.


---

## 1. General Principles

- Write **clean, readable, and maintainable code**.
- Prioritize **type safety** using TypeScript.
- Emphasize **component reusability** and **single responsibility**.
- Encourage **collaboration** and **code reviews**.
- Keep **user experience**, **accessibility**, and **performance** as core goals.

---

## 2. Project Structure & Organization

### 2.1. Directory Structure

- Use a **feature-based** or **domain-driven** folder structure: group components, hooks, and logic by feature, not by type.
- Example:
  ```
  src/
    features/
      users/
        components/
        hooks/
        services/
      posts/
        ...
    shared/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
    app/
      routes/
      layouts/
      App.tsx
  ```
- Keep files and folders names consistent and descriptive, using `camelCase` for files, `PascalCase` for components.

### 2.2. Separation of Concerns

- Separate **UI**, **logic**, **state management**, and **data fetching**.
- Avoid putting business logic inside UI components.

### 2.3. Scalability

- Design for future growth: feature modules, lazy loading, and code splitting from the start.

---

## 3. Component Design

### 3.1. Functional Components

- Use **function components** with hooks; avoid class components unless maintaining legacy code.

### 3.2. Single Responsibility

- Each component should do **one thing** well.
- Break down large components into smaller, reusable pieces.

### 3.3. Props & State

- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for props and state.
- Prefer local state for UI, and global state for cross-cutting concerns only.

### 3.4. Children & Composition

- Use `children` and composition over inheritance for extensibility.
- Use [Compound Component](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks) pattern for complex UI.

### 3.5. Stateless vs Stateful

- Prefer **stateless (presentational)** components where possible.
- Use stateful components for logic, data fetching, and state transitions.

### 3.6. Memoization

- Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to optimize unnecessary renders.
- Avoid overusing memoization; profile when in doubt.

### 3.7. Error Boundaries

- Use error boundary components to catch and handle errors in the UI gracefully.

---

## 4. State Management

### 4.1. Local State

- Use `useState`, `useReducer` for local state management.
- Keep state as close to where it’s used as possible.

### 4.2. Global State

- Use Context API for simple global state.
- For complex state, prefer libraries like Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil.

### 4.3. Avoid Prop Drilling

- Use context or custom hooks to avoid passing props deeply.

---

## 5. Data Fetching

### 5.1. Fetching Patterns

- Use custom hooks (`useFetch`, `useQuery`) for data fetching logic.
- Use libraries like SWR or React Query for caching, revalidation, and remote state.

### 5.2. Error and Loading States

- Always handle loading, error, and empty states in the UI.
- Provide user feedback for all async operations.

### 5.3. Data Normalization

- Normalize fetched data for efficient state updates.

---

## 6. Hooks

### 6.1. Custom Hooks

- Encapsulate logic and side-effects in custom hooks.
- Name hooks with `use` prefix: `useForm`, `useUser`, etc.

### 6.2. Hook Rules

- Only call hooks at the top level of function components or other hooks.
- Never call hooks conditionally or inside loops.

---

## 7. Styling

### 7.1. CSS-in-JS / Modules

- Use CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion, or TailwindCSS for component-level styling.
- Avoid inline styles for dynamic or reusable styling.

### 7.2. Theming

- Use ThemeProvider/context for global themes.
- Support dark/light modes and user preferences.

### 7.3. Responsiveness

- Design mobile-first layouts.
- Use media queries or utility classes for responsive design.

---

## 8. Accessibility (a11y)

### 8.1. Semantic HTML

- Always use proper semantic HTML elements.
- Avoid div/span soup.

### 8.2. ARIA Attributes

- Use ARIA only when necessary for custom components.
- Ensure ARIA roles do not override native semantics.

### 8.3. Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- Manage focus programmatically where needed.

### 8.4. Contrast & Readability

- Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.

---

## 9. Performance Optimization

### 9.1. Lazy Loading

- Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code splitting and lazy loading components.

### 9.2. Virtualization

- Use virtualization libraries (react-window, react-virtualized) for large lists.

### 9.3. Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders

- Use keys on lists.
- Avoid recreating functions/objects in render.

### 9.4. Bundle Analysis

- Analyze and optimize bundle size regularly.

---

## 10. Testing

### 10.1. Unit Testing

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests.
- Test all components, hooks, and utilities.

### 10.2. Integration & E2E Testing

- Use Cypress or Playwright for integration/E2E tests.

### 10.3. Coverage

- Target >80% meaningful test coverage.
- Don’t test implementation details, test behavior.

---

## 11. API Integration

### 11.1. API Layer

- Encapsulate API calls in `/services` or `/api` modules.
- Validate all API responses and handle errors gracefully.

### 11.2. Authentication

- Use secure storage for tokens (prefer HttpOnly cookies).
- Never expose sensitive info in the client bundle.

---

## 12. Documentation

### 12.1. Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc and TypeScript for documenting functions, components, and hooks.
- Comment complex logic, not the obvious.

### 12.2. Project Documentation

- Maintain an updated `README.md` with setup, scripts, and conventions.
- Document all reusable components and custom hooks.

---

## 13. Code Quality & Reviews

### 13.1. Linting & Formatting

- Use ESLint and Prettier, enforce as pre-commit hooks.
- Adhere to established style guides.

### 13.2. Pull Requests

- All changes via PR, with meaningful titles and descriptions.
- Require reviews from at least one other developer.

---

## 14. Error Handling & Monitoring

### 14.1. Error Boundaries

- Use error boundaries to catch and display UI errors.

### 14.2. Logging

- Log errors to external monitoring tools (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Never expose sensitive error details to users.

---

## 15. Version Control

### 15.1. Git Practices

- Use feature branches and conventional commits.
- Squash and rebase for clean history.

---

## 16. Security

### 16.1. Dependency Management

- Audit dependencies regularly.

- Never commit secrets to version control.
- Use `.env.example` as a template.

---

## 18. CI/CD & Deployment

### 18.1. Pipelines

- Automate linting, testing, and builds in CI.
- Block deploys on failed checks.

### 18.2. Hosting

- Use CDN for static assets.
